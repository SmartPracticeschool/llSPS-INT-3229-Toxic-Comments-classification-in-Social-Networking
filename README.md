Toxic Comments classification in Social Networking
Detecting and controlling verbal abuse in an automated fashion is inherently a natural language processing task. Natural Language Processing, (NLP), is a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and humans using the natural language. The ultimate objective of NLP is to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of the human languages in a manner that is valuable. Text classification is a classic topic for natural language processing and an essential component in many applications, such as web searching, information filtering, topic categorization and sentiment analysis. Text transformation is the very first step in any form of text classification. The online comments are generally in non-standard English and contain lots of spelling mistakes partly because of types but more importantly because of the deliberate attempt to write the abusive comments in creative ways.
